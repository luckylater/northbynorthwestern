# dotcom
[northbynorthwestern.com](http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/) was created in 1865 by our forefolx of yore. Since then, the Internet has been created! Ppl [use](https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2017-a934b801fbe) JavaScript?! News is read on phones!

Okay, but really. The old website has served its purpose. We are *SO* grateful for people who made it in the first place and we are *SO* proud to be one of the only student publications where students created and maintain their own website. Because of that, we want to continue making dotcom better for our reporters and editors, readers, and developers! The website right now is like... [gif](https://i.imgur.com/WWsGOwu.gif)
We want the website to be like...

So here's how we're going to do it!

## The plan

### Frontend
We're planning to use React to implement the reader-facing side of our site. A few of NBN's designers created a comprehensive style guide for the new site, so we'll use that to design it.

### Backend
We want the reporter-facing side of the site to gel with the natural workflow of our staff. The editorial team uses Google docs for writing and collaborating on stories, so we want to build a backend that works seamlessly with the team's current processes. We'll use the Google Drive API (along with tools like ArchieML and Amazon S3) to pull articles directly from writers' docs to the site.
